# Moroccan Tic Tac Toe Android Game

## Introduction
This is a Tic Tac Toe game developed for Android, based on the Moroccan culture, following the MVVM pattern. The game is played between two players, represented by the X and O symbols, on a 3x3 grid. The game follows the traditional rules of Tic Tac Toe, with the additional cultural twist of using Moroccan-themed graphics and sounds.

## Prerequisites
- Android SDK (version 24 or higher)
- Android Virtual Device or physical Android device for testing

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from Github.
2. Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project".
3. Navigate to the cloned repository and select the tic-tac-toe directory.
4. Build and run the project using an Android Virtual Device or physical Android device.

## MVVM Pattern
The app is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. The main components of the pattern used in the app are:

- Model: Represents the data and logic of the game, such as the board state and the rules of the game.
- View: The UI of the app, including the layout and user input handling.
- ViewModel: Acts as a mediator between the Model and View components, and handles the logic for displaying data and handling user actions.
By separating the app into these components, the app is easier to develop, test, and maintain.

## Note
This game is not completed yet due of the lack of time, if anyone want to contribute you are welcome. 
things that I want to add are: 
- setting menu: you can change the plan where you can play (`zarbya`).
- bot player: add a bot player with different level.
- sound effects: add some sound effects in moroccan dialect to make it more funny.
